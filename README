Tamanegi -- RSS/Atom feeds aggregator
=====================================

The project previous name was RaPlanet. But there is another project with
the same name, so I changed the name to Tamanegi (onion in japanese).
Maybe somebody will remember the Matz' presentation on Rubykaigi 2006
"The state of the onion" :) Tamanegi also trying to observe the state of
the net and aggregate atom/rss feeds in one news stream.

Live demo of the application can be seen on URL: http://planet.zhekov.net/


Application details
--------------------

This is the command line only version of Tamanegi.

 * ORM (model): Sequel (_core and _model)


Prerequirements (needed gems)
-----------------------------

 * sqlite3-ruby (database)
 * validatable (models validation checks)
 * sequel (ORM)
 * feed-normalizer (feeds parsing)
 * builder (feeds)


Usage
------

[!] Change the settings in the config.rb file - base_url, items per page etc.

 * Command line usage

You can use Tamanegi just to fill your database with items and display them with
something else (Ruby on Rails etc.). So from irb or a script

 require 'tamanegi'
 Tamanegi::sync!(false,true)

 * Adding new feeds:

 $ irb
 > require 'tamanegi'
 => true
 > f = Feed.add('SomeHandler', 'http://www.example.com/feed.rss')
 ...
 > f.sync!
 => 200
 > f.save
 ...
 # print available feeds
 > Feed.print(:handle,:url)
 # sync all feeds
 > Tamanegi::sync!(false,true)
